# PHP Control Structures & Loops: Exercises

Just like our last round of exercises, these will be algorithmic (i.e. they will follow a series of logical steps) and will help us solve specific problems through the lense of this new language. 

---

## Problem 1

Write a program that takes a numerical value and checks to see whether it's positive, negative, zero, or not a number.

---

## Problem 2

Write a program that takes a numerical value and prints its multiplication table.

---

## Problem 3

Write a program that checks the day of the week using the `date()` function.

    Hint: You can get the name of the day of the week by passing in "l".

Print a message telling the user what day it is. Next, using a switch statement, check the day of the week and tell the user what day it would correspond to in the Old Norse calendar. 

Here are the names of the days of the week in the Old Norse calendar, along with the gods and goddesses they were named after:

    Sun's Day (Sunnudagr) - named after the goddess Sunna
    Moon's Day (Mánadagr) - named after the god Máni
    Tyr's Day (Týsdagr) - named after the god Tyr
    Odin's Day (Óðinsdagr) - named after the god Odin
    Thor's Day (Þórsdagr) - named after the god Thor
    Freyja's Day (Freyjudagr) - named after the goddess Freyja
    Saturn's Day (Laugardagr) - named after the planet Saturn
