/*
    This script will create a table in our database and add some data to it. Even if you use the GUI to create tables and records in PHPMyAdmin, it's a good idea to keep a copy of your original script, just in case something happens and you have to drop the table and start again.

-- All queries have a certain order to them. This one creates a table, defines all of its columns, and determines which data type each column will be. We also have to decide whether a column allows null data and what the primary key is. 

CREATE TABLE cities (
    -- Add the rest of the lines with your instructor here!
);

-- After running this (in PHPMyAdmin, selecting the database, going to SQL, pasting it in and hitting 'Go'), let's add some data.

-- Next, let's write an insert statements to insert some values into our table.
