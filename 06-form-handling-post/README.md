# Form Handling (via the POST Method)

Processing forms is extremely common. They allow us to capture some sort of data with the user and _do something_ with it. For many websites and web applications, forms (and, as we'll cover later, databases) are the backbone for dynamic functionality. 

Each form has two important attributes, which we'll cover much more in depth: `action` and `method`.

## Form Actions

The `action` attribute specifies what will handle or process the data once the form is submitted. It can be a separate file (ex. `process.php`), or the 

If we want the page with the form on it to handle everything, we can use the following value:  

```PHP
    <form action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
``` 

Keep in mind that if we `include()` a separate script that will handle our data, PHP will act as if it's on the same page.

### $_SERVER

So, what is `$_SERVER`? It's something called a _superglobal variable_, which is a predefined array that any part of our script can access (i.e. it has a global scope). 

Specifically, `$_SERVER` provides information about the server and the current request. This can include server and execution environment details, such as URL paths, request method, IP address, and more.

## Form Methods

The `method` value of a form specifies the way (i.e. the HTTP method) that the data will be sent. It can take two possible values: "GET" and "POST".

It's important to choose the appropriate method based on the intended functionality and security requirements of your form. 

### GET

`GET` is the default method if no method attribute is specified. It is commonly used for retrieving data from the server or performing searches. 

`GET` transmits data from one page to another by sending it as part of the URL, called the `query string`. This means that a specific state can be bookmarked, shared, or saved just by saving the URL; however, this also means that the user can directly manipulate things by changing the URL.

Because all of the submitted data is visible in the URL, never use the `GET` method if the form handles any sensitive or personally identifying information, such as email addresses, date of birth, passwords, credit card information, and so forth.

Finally, when are using the GET method, we are limited to a maximum of 2,048 characters, minus the number of characters in the actual path. 

### POST

When the form is submitted using the `POST` method, the form data is not directly visible in the URL. Instead, it is sent in the body of the HTTP request.

This method is commonly used for sending sensitive or large amounts of data to the server, such as submitting forms with passwords or uploading files. However, the data is not bookmarkable or shareable directly through the URL.

### $_GET and $_POST

Whenever a form is submitted, the data is assigned to either the $_GET or $_POST superglobal variable. It is an associative array, where each key is the `name` of an input and each value is whatever the user submitted. 

We access these values in the same way that we would access any array's stored values.

If we want to access data sent via `GET`, we could access it this way:

```PHP
    $username = $_GET['username'];
    echo "Welcome, $username!";
```

Accessing data sent by `POST` works in the same way:

```PHP
    $username = $_POST['username'];
```

However, it's a good idea to put these assignments behind an `if` statement. If we do not check to see whether or not the superglobal variable _has_ any values in it yet -- that is, if we don't check to see if the form has been submitted -- we will be inviting a whole host of errors to our application. 

We can do this by checking to see if the value for the submit button has been set (i.e. if the user has clicked it), or checking to see if any data was sent using `POST`: 

```PHP
    // Is there a value for something with a name of 'submit'?
    if (isset($_GET['submit'])) { ... }

    // Did we get here using the POST method?
    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') { ... }
```
